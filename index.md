### My "first" demo website
This is a simple website that demonstrates the workflow
to create/edit markdown files using VSCode, push them to a 
GitHub repository, build and deploy a collection of HTML files 
using GitHub Pages, and view the result in Safari.

By "first", I am referring to efforts in 2025. I did some similar work a few years 
ago, but it is completely forgotten.
