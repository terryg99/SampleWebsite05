### My "first" demo website
This website demonstrates the workflow to create/edit markdown files using VSCode, push them to a 
GitHub repository, build and deploy a collection of HTML files using GitHub Pages, and view the result in Safari.

This site demonstrates the minimal-mistakes theme for Jekyll, which is a powerful and flexible theme for building personal or professional websites. It is organized in markdown files with front matter that allows for easy customization of titles, dates, categories, and tags.
