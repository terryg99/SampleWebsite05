### Some early thoughts on AI

I have been slow to embrace AI technology ... I couldn't imagine that it could live up to the hype it has been getting. I was wrong. It's pretty amazing!

My interest picked up when I learned that AI-based code assistance was being added to Xcode 26. As a card-carrying (I paid mmy $99) Apple Developer, I downloaded beta releases of macOS 26 Tahoe and Xcode 26. Limited use of ChatGPT LLM is included with Xcode (it's hard to determine where exactly the limit is) and I also subscribed to Anthropic and invested the crazy sum of $5 to try out their APIs (Claude, Sonnet) as well. Xcode allows me to choose which LLM I wish to use.

Most of my use of AI in Xcode has been to resolve errors. I'd say it works about 80% of the time, usually on the first attempt, but sometimes it takes a follow-up prompt to resolve the issue. I haven't tinkered much with giving it broad instructions to see how it would generate code based on more general guidance. It works well, and I've only scratched the surface.

My real delight with AI is as a learning tool. it's like having a dedicated, knowledgeable tutor, who never tires of my endless questions. Mostly I have used AI Mode in Google which I understand employs the Gemini 2.5 LLM. And I have also tried ChatGPT some with similar results. My typical prompt starts with "Tell me about ... " or "Suggest a few references on ... " or "Provide me a couple examples of ..."

As amazing as the capability is, it's even more amazing that (for the most part) it is free.
