I grew up in northwestern Ohio and went to Purdue University, obtiaining BSCE and MSCE degrees in Structural Engineering. After graduating, I moved to Houston and joined Exxon's upstream research organization, initially working in their Platform Design section. My first international assignment was in Oslo, Norway where I participated on the Snorre Project.

During my career with Exxon I also had assignemnts in Stavanger (Norway), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and Doha (Qatar) and spent a lot of time in Jakarta (Indonesia) and Australia. Between foreign assignments which totalled 15 years, I worked in Houston in a number of positions, mostly related to upstream development projects.

I bought my first personal computer in 1981, an Apple II+. My entire career I used what eventually became Windows-based PCs. After retiring I bought an iMac, my first Apple computer in over 30 years. My current desktop is a 2023 Mac Studio.
